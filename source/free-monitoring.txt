Monitored Data
--------------

Free monitoring provides information about your deployment, including:

- Operation Execution Times

- Memory Usage

- CPU Usage

- Operation Counts

The data expires 24 hours after being uploaded.

Monitored Data and Expiration
-----------------------------

When enabled, the monitored data is uploaded periodically. The
monitored data expires after 24 hours. That is, you can only access
monitored data that has been uploaded within the past 24 hours.

If you disable free monitoring and later re-enable free monitoring, you
can access your previous metrics that have not expired within the past
24 hours.

Monitoring URL
--------------

When you enable free monitoring, you are provided with a unique
URL where you can access your monitored data.

.. important::

   Anyone with whom you share this unique URL can access your monitored
   data.
